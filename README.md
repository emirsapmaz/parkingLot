# 🚀 Parking Lot Project

This is a full-stack Spring application I developed during my second internship at Istanbul Grand Airport (IGA). The project simulates a small-scale parking lot system, enabling users to perform CRUD operations on car plates. This was my first experience working with the Spring Framework, and I also independently designed and implemented the frontend using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into Spring development, front-end design, and full-stack project workflow.

## 🔥 Features
- ✨ **CRUD Functionality**– Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for car plates.
- 🛠️ **MVC Architecture & Clean Code** – Implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern with a focus on clean, maintainable code.
- 🌐 **MySQL Database Integration** – Utilizes MySQL for efficient and reliable data storage.
- 👻 **User Authentication** – Features Login, Registration, and Main Pages to ensure secure access and smooth navigation.

## 📦 **Installation**  
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local environment:  

1. **Create the Database**  
   - Open **MySQL Workbench** and create a new schema named **`parkinglot`**.  
   - Ensure the schema name matches the one defined in **`application.properties`** to avoid connection issues.  

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   - Download the project files using the following command:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/emirsapmaz/parkingLot.git
     cd repository
     ```

3. **Import the Project**  
   - Open your **IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)** and import the project as a **Maven/Gradle project**.  

4. **Run the Application**  
   - Launch the application using your IDE's **Run** option or with:  
     ```bash
